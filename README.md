# About the book:
In my recent 5E campaign, I wanted to give my players something easy and engaging to do during their downtime in the tavern. After a bit of searching, I came across the d8 poker dice set from Koplow Games, which turned out to be the perfectsolution. With a few slight modifications, I created a simple and fun dice game calledFive Kings that fits seamlessly into our fantasy world.If you're interested in picking up the d8 poker dice set for yourself, you can find them here on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Koplow-Games-Poker-Dice-Game/dp/B0013CY0TQ)
